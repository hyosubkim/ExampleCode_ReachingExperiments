Example codes to run visuomotor experiments. Additional scripts for creating protocols ('.tgt' files) and loading subject data as well. 'GetMouseVMR.m' is meant to be run on laptop for beta testing. 'samplegame.m' is intended for collecting data from Wacom graphics tablets (tested on Wacom Intuos 4XL). 

Note: Users will likely have to make minor edits (e.g., changing directory commands) in order for scripts to run properly on their set-ups.
