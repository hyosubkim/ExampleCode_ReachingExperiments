Example codes to run visuomotor experiments. 'GetMouseVMR.m' is meant to be run on laptop for beta testing. 'sample_game.m' is intended for collecting data from Wacom graphics tablets (tested on Wacom Intuos 4XL). 

Users will likely have to make minor edits to the experiment code (e.g., changing directory commands) in order for them to run properly on their set-ups. The supporting scripts for creating protocols (i.e., '.tgt' files) and loading subject data are provided as examples and will likely require more extensive editing for individual use.
